# LandmarkDevs Core Libraries

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jqjjbmhp7296aa13?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tstephansen/landmarkdevs-core-libraries)

This project contains three libraries that are most commonly used in WPF applications that I create.

## Summary
### Infrastructure Library
This library contains Observable and RelayCommand classes for ViewModels, error tracking functions, and logging functions.

### Prism Library
This library is useful when using the [Prism Library](https://github.com/PrismLibrary) in an application.

### Security Library
This library contains security functions for WPF applications. Credit for this belongs to the contributors to the following repository [Password-Hashing](https://github.com/defuse/password-hashing). That code is mainly used for hashing passwords.

### Shared Library
This library contains a Guid Generator that was written by [fluentcassandra](https://github.com/fluentcassandra/fluentcassandra), a change tracking model, a tracking message model, some extension methods, and a helper class used for progress reporting during async operations.

### Telemetry Library
This library contains classes useful for telemetry tracking with HockeyApp.
